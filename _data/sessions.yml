  title: "Big Data - The Cloud Way"
  description: "Big Data (aka 'Data' at Google) projects in the past were less successful than one would imagine, as it usually involves managing complex clusters of machines and multiple software stacks. Over the past 10 years Google was forced to invent new methods for processing, analysing and running predictions over large data sets for batch and real-time insights. Today these tools go far beyond MapReduce and can be used by anyone. Google has only just started externalising some of these internal tools to the public as managed services. We will look at some of these tools and see why the cloud is a great place to run your next projects, whether these involve analysing click streams, gathering sensor data or interpreting social streams."
