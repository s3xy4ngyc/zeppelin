GDG DevFest Munich 2015 will be held 16th of October in Munich. If you want to be part of this great event as a speaker you knocked at the good door.

#### Presenters â€“ who should speak at the DevFest Conference?

* developers (freelance and hired)
* companies developing software (apps, tools, frameworks etc.)

If you belong to one of those groups you are cordially invited to submit a talk proposal (or a number of proposals). An independent program committee assesses the proposals and selects the actual conference talks.<br/>
